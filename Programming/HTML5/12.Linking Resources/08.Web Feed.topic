A **web feed** is a standardized way for websites to **publish frequently updated content** so that users or applications can automatically receive the updates without visiting the website manually.


#### Key Points About Web Feeds:

1. **Purpose**
   Web feeds allow users to stay updated with new content like:

   * Blog posts
   * News articles
   * Podcasts
   * Any dynamic content on a website

2. **Formats**
   The most common web feed formats are:

   * **RSS (Really Simple Syndication)** → Uses XML, widely supported.
   * **Atom** → A newer XML-based format with more strict standards.

3. **How They Work**

   * Websites provide a feed URL (e.g., `https://example.com/feed.xml`).
   * Users can subscribe to this feed using a **feed reader** or aggregator (like Feedly or browser extensions).
   * Whenever the website updates, the feed reader automatically fetches and shows the new content.

4. **Example**

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://example.com/feed.xml">
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="http://example.com/feed.xml">
```

Here, the `<link rel="alternate">` tells browsers and feed readers where the web feed is located.
