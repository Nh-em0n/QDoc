Many symbols and special characters are required while developing a web page in HTML. However, sometimes using these characters directly may interfere with the actual HTML code, as certain characters are **reserved**, and others may not be **available on the keyboard**.

To avoid these conflicts while still being able to use different symbols, **W3C provides “Character Entities.”**

Character Entities are predefined in two forms:

* **Entity Name:** `&amp;entity_name;`
* **Entity Number:** `&amp;entity_number;`

You can use either of these formats to render the required symbol on a webpage.

### Example

Using a character entity for a **magnifying glass** icon:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="🔍 Search">
```
