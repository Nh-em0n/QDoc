</md></sn><sn><md>### Why Itâ€™s Better to Practice Git on the Command Line

* **Deeper Understanding:** The command line forces you to learn Git concepts rather than relying on buttons.
* **Universal Skills:** Commands work the same across all environments, servers, and systems.
* **Full Power:** Some advanced features are only available in the command line.
* **Troubleshooting:** When problems occur, solutions are usually given in command line form.

&gt; Practicing Git on the command line builds a strong foundation, making it easier to switch to GUI tools or IDE integrations later.
