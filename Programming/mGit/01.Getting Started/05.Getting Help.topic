           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]

You can get detailed help for any Git command in multiple ways:

```bash

or

```bash
git  [command] --help
```

or

```bash
man git-[command]
```

For example:

```bash
git help commit

man git-commit
```
