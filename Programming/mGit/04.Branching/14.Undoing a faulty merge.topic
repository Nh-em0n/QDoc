Merging is a routine Git operation that integrates changes from one branch into another. However, sometimes a merge introduces unwanted changes or is performed on the wrong branch. In such cases, it is important to know how to **undo a faulty merge** without breaking your repository.

There are two primary ways to undo a merge in Git:

1. **Resetting with `git reset --hard HEAD~1`**
2. **Reverting with `git revert -m 1`**

Each method works differently, and choosing the right one depends on the situation.

<sn><md>### 1. Undoing with reset {.text-center}

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### What it does: {.text-center}
* Moves the branch pointer back by one commit (removes the merge commit).
* Discards all changes introduced by the merge.
* Completely erases history of the merge as if it never happened.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### When to use: {.text-center}
* If the merge commit has **not been pushed** to a remote repository.
* If you want to **completely remove** all traces of the merge.
* Suitable for fixing mistakes locally before sharing your work.
:::

:::

#### Caution:

* This is **destructive**. All uncommitted work will be lost.
* If the commit was already pushed and shared, rewriting history may cause issues for collaborators.
</md></sn><sn><md>### 2. Undoing with `revert` {.text-center}

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_hash>
```

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### What it does:{.text-center}
* Creates a new commit that **reverses the changes** introduced by the merge.
* Keeps the history intact (the merge commit still exists, but its effects are neutralized).
* `-m 1` specifies the parent branch to preserve (usually the branch you merged into).
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### When to use:{.text-center}
* If the merge commit has already been **pushed to a remote repository**.
* When you need to **undo the changes but keep history clean and collaborative-friendly**.
* Useful in shared projects where history should not be rewritten.
:::
:::

#### Caution:

* The merge commit remains in history, only its changes are undone.
* May introduce new conflicts if reverting is not straightforward.</merge_commit_hash></md></sn><sn><md>### Differentiation at a Glance{.text-center}

| Method                     | Effect                              | Use Case                                | Caution                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1`  | Deletes the merge commit entirely   | Undoing local merges not yet pushed     | Destructive, rewrites history              |
| `git revert -m 1 commit-id` | Adds a new commit that undoes merge | Undoing merges already pushed to remote | Keeps history but may create new conflicts |
</md></sn><sn><md>### Best Practices and Caution{.text-center}

* Always check `git log` to confirm which commit you are reverting/resetting.
* Use `git reset --hard` only for local work that has not been shared.
* Use `git revert -m 1` for undoing merges in **team environments**.
* Consider creating a backup branch before performing either action:

  ```bash
  git branch backup-before-undo
  ```
</md></sn><sn><md>### Conclusion

Undoing a faulty merge in Git can be done either by **resetting** (to completely erase the merge) or by **reverting** (to undo changes while preserving history). The correct approach depends on whether the merge has been shared with others. By using these tools carefully, you can maintain a clean and reliable Git history.</md></sn>
