Merging in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. Sometimes, while merging, you may encounter unexpected conflicts or realize that the merge was started by mistake. In such situations, Git allows you to **abort the merge** and return your repository to the state it was in before the merge began.

<sn><md>### What Does Aborting a Merge Mean?{.text-center .fg-red}

When you start a merge, Git begins integrating commits from one branch into the current branch. If [conflicts occur]{.fg-red} or you decide not to continue, you can abort the merge. Aborting a merge:

* Cancels the merge process.
* Restores the branch to its pre-merge state.
* Discards any conflict markers and staged changes related to the merge.

The command for this is:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 1: Initialize a New Repository{.text-center}

```bash
git init abort-merge-demo
cd abort-merge-demo
```
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 2: Create an Initial Commit on `main`{.text-center}
```bash
echo "Hello from main branch" &gt; file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"
```
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 3: Create a New Branch and Make Changes{.text-center}
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
echo "Hello from feature branch" &gt; file.txt
git commit -am "Update file.txt in feature branch"
```

Now, the `feature-branch` has a different version of `file.txt` than `main`.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 4: Switch Back to `main` and Make Another Change{.text-center}

```bash
git checkout main
echo "Hello again from main branch" &gt; file.txt
git commit -am "Update file.txt in main branch"
```

At this point, both `main` and `feature-branch` have conflicting changes in `file.txt`.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 5: Try to Merge `feature-branch` into `main`{.text-center}

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

Git will stop and report a **merge conflict** in `file.txt`:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Step 6: Abort the Merge{.text-center}

Instead of resolving the conflict, you decide to cancel the merge:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

Now Git restores the repository to the exact state it was in before the merge attempt.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Verifying the Abort{.text-center}

Run:

```bash
git status
```

You will see that no merge is in progress, and the branch is clean again.

The file `file.txt` remains as it was in the `main` branch, and the attempted merge has been discarded.
