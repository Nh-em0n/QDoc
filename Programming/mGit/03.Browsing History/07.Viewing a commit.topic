When working with Git, understanding the changes made in a specific commit is essential for tracking history, debugging, or reviewing code. Git provides several ways to view commits, both **absolute** (by hash) and **relative** (from `HEAD`), as well as ways to inspect **files changed** in a commit.</md></sn>

<sn><md>### Viewing a Commit by Absolute Hash{.text-center}

Every commit in Git has a unique **SHA-1 hash**. You can view the details of a specific commit using its hash:

```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git show 5a1fe0d
```

This will display:

* Commit metadata (author, date, commit message)
* Full diff of the changes made in that commit

Absolute hashes are useful when you know the exact commit you want to inspect.</commit-hash></md></sn><sn><md>### Viewing a Commit by Relative Reference{.text-center}

To see the last commit use `HEAD`

```bash
git show HEAD
```

Git allows you to reference commits **relative to `HEAD`** using `HEAD~n`, where `n` is the number of commits before `HEAD`.

```bash
git show HEAD~2
```

This shows the commit **two steps back** from the current `HEAD`.
You can combine this with `git log` to navigate history quickly:

```bash
git log --oneline
```
</md></sn><sn><md>### Viewing Changes for a Specific File{.text-center}

To view a commitâ€™s changes for a **specific file**, append the file path at the end of the `git show` command:

```bash
git show <commit-hash> -- file-path
#or
git show HEAD~n -- file-path
#or
git show HEAD~n:file-path

```

**Example:**

```bash
git show 5a1fe0d -- README.md
```

This will display only the changes made to `README.md` in that commit.</commit-hash></md></sn><sn><md>### Listing Files Changed {.text-center}

If you only want to **see which files were changed** in a commit without the diff details:

```bash
git show --name-only commit-hash
```

**Example:**

```bash
git show --name-only 5a1fe0d
```

Output:

```
README.md
src/app.js
```</md></sn><sn><md>### Listing Files with Status {.text-center}

The `--name-status` option shows files along with their **change type**:

* `A` = Added
* `M` = Modified
* `D` = Deleted

```bash
git show --name-status <commit-hash>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git show --name-status 5a1fe0d
```

Output:

```
M   README.md
A   src/new_feature.js
D   src/old_file.js
```

This gives a quick overview of what was added, modified, or removed in a commit.

| Method                 | Command                         | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Absolute hash          | `git show commit_hash`               | View a specific commit by SHA       |
| Relative               | `git show HEAD~n`               | View commits relative to HEAD       |
| Specific file          | `git show commit_hash -- <file>` <br> `git show HEAD~n:file`     | See changes for a particular file   |
| List changed files     | `git show --name-only commit_hash` <br> `git show --name-only HEAD~n`  | See only which files changed        |
| List files with status | `git show --name-status commit_hash` | See files changed with A/M/D status |

These commands provide a flexible way to inspect the history and changes in your repository at different levels of detail.</file></md></sn><sn><md>## Practise{.text-center}
