<sn><md>### `index.mjs` :

```js
export { default } from './lib/index.mjs';
```

is an **ECMAScript Module (ESM)** entry point — it simply **re-exports the default export** from another module file (`./lib/index.mjs`).

#### Purpose

This file acts as a **"main" entry point** for ESM builds of the package. When someone does:

```js
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it';
```

and the package's `package.json` points to `index.mjs` (via the `exports` or `module` field), this file ensures that:

* The actual logic from `./lib/index.mjs` is loaded.
* The consumer gets the correct export (`MarkdownIt` class or default API object).


#### What's in `./lib/index.mjs`?

That file typically looks like:

```js
import MarkdownIt from './parser.mjs';  // or internal logic

export default MarkdownIt;
```

So in essence:

```js
index.mjs
 └── re-exports from → ./lib/index.mjs
      └── exports MarkdownIt class/function
```

#### Why Not Put Everything in `index.mjs`?

To keep things modular and maintainable:

* `index.mjs` is kept minimal (like a root redirect).
* All real code lives in `lib/`, so CommonJS (`lib/index.js`) and ESM (`lib/index.mjs`) can have mirrored logic.

#### When You See This?

You usually see this kind of structure in:

* Dual-package modules (`.js` for CommonJS, `.mjs` for ESM).
* Library distribution folders (`dist/` or `lib/`) that separate source and entry.


#### Summary

```js
export { default } from './lib/index.mjs';
```

* Means: “Whatever is `export default` from `./lib/index.mjs`, export it here too.”
* Purpose: Clean re-export entry point for ESM consumers.
* Common in packages supporting both CommonJS (`require`) and ESM (`import`) systems.
