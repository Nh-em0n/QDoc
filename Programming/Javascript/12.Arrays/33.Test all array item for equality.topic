The `.every()` method in JavaScript is a powerful tool used to test whether **all elements** in an array satisfy a given condition. It is commonly applied to perform validations, consistency checks, or comparisons across array elements.

<sn><md>### Understanding the `.every()` Method

The `.every()` method tests each element of an array against a provided **predicate function** (a function that returns `true` or `false`).
If **all elements** pass the test, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
array.every(callback(element, index, array))
```

**Parameters:**

* **callback:** A function that tests each element.
* **element:** The current element being processed.
* **index (optional):** The index of the current element.
* **array (optional):** The array being processed.

**Returns:**
`true` if every element passes the test; otherwise, `false`.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Test for Equality (Primitive Values)

If you want to check whether all elements in an array are **equal to the first element**, you can use `.every()` as follows:

```javascript
[1, 2, 1].every(function(item, i, list) {
  return item === list[0];
}); 
// false
```

In this example, the result is `false` because not all elements are equal to the first element (`1`).

Now consider another array:

```javascript
[1, 1, 1].every(function(item, i, list) {
  return item === list[0];
}); 
// true
```

Here, all elements are equal to the first item, so the result is `true`.

+++ Using ES6 Arrow Functions

Modern JavaScript (ES6 and later) allows for a cleaner syntax using **arrow functions**:

```javascript
[1, 1, 1].every((item, i, list) =&gt; item === list[0]);
// true
```

This version is functionally identical but more concise.

When working with **arrays of objects**, comparing equality directly (`item === list[0]`) won’t work because objects are compared by reference, not by value.

Example:

```javascript
let data = [
  { name: "alice", id: 111 },
  { name: "alice", id: 222 }
];

data.every(function(item, i, list) {
  return item === list[0];
});
// false
```

Even though both objects have the same `name`, they are different objects in memory. Hence, the equality test returns `false`.

To check if all objects share the same **property value**, you can compare specific properties:

```javascript
data.every(function(item, i, list) {
  return item.name === list[0].name;
});
// true
```

This comparison returns `true` because both objects have the same `name` property value (`"alice"`).

+++ Using ES6 Arrow Function for Objects

You can make the same check more concise with an arrow function:

```javascript
data.every((item, i, list) =&gt; item.name === list[0].name);
// true
```

| Type of Check                  | Example                                          | Result  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Primitive values not all equal | `[1, 2, 1].every(...)`                           | `false` |
| Primitive values all equal     | `[1, 1, 1].every(...)`                           | `true`  |
| Object reference equality      | `data.every(item =&gt; item === data[0])`           | `false` |
| Object property equality       | `data.every(item =&gt; item.name === data[0].name)` | `true`  |
</md></sn><sn><md>### Key Takeaways

* The `.every()` method checks if **all elements** meet a condition.
* It returns a **boolean** (`true` or `false`).
* For **primitives**, direct comparison (`===`) works.
* For **objects**, compare specific properties instead of entire objects.
* The method is **non-destructive** — it does not modify the original array.

This makes `.every()` an efficient and elegant solution for testing equality and consistency across elements in an array.

+++ Problem Scenario

A **university portal** stores student data in an array of objects.
Before publishing the final exam results online, the admin wants to verify that **all students have submitted their assignments**.

If every student has submitted, the results can be released. Otherwise, the admin should be alerted that some students are missing submissions.

---

#### Example Data

```javascript
const students = [
  { name: "Alice", submitted: true },
  { name: "Bob", submitted: true },
  { name: "Charlie", submitted: false },
  { name: "David", submitted: true }
];
```

Each student object has a property `submitted` that indicates whether they have submitted their assignment.

---

**The Goal :** <br>
Check if **all students** have `submitted: true`.


#### Solution Using `Array.every()`

```javascript
const allSubmitted = students.every(student =&gt; student.submitted === true);

if (allSubmitted) {
  console.log("✅ All students have submitted their assignments. Results can be published!");
} else {
  console.log("⚠️ Some students have not submitted their assignments. Please check!");
}
```

---

#### Output

```
⚠️ Some students have not submitted their assignments. Please check!
```

---

#### Explanation

* The `.every()` method tests each element in the `students` array.
* The callback `(student =&gt; student.submitted === true)` checks if each student’s `submitted` property is `true`.
* Since **Charlie** has `submitted: false`, the method returns `false`.
* The condition inside the `if` statement triggers the appropriate message.

---

#### Another Example — All Students Submitted

If we update the data:

```javascript
const students = [
  { name: "Alice", submitted: true },
  { name: "Bob", submitted: true },
  { name: "Charlie", submitted: true },
  { name: "David", submitted: true }
];
```

Then the output becomes:

```
✅ All students have submitted their assignments. Results can be published!
```

---

#### Why `.every()` is Useful in Real Scenarios

| Use Case                | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Form Validation**     | Check if all form fields are filled correctly before submission.  |
| **E-commerce Orders**   | Ensure every item in a cart is available before checkout.         |
| **Attendance Tracking** | Confirm all employees are marked present for a day.               |
| **Data Consistency**    | Verify that all records meet specific criteria before processing. |

---

#### Summary

The `Array.every()` method is ideal for **verification and validation tasks** in real-world applications.
In this university example, it efficiently checks whether all students meet a condition (`submitted === true`) and ensures data readiness before taking an action (publishing results).

It’s simple, readable, and perfectly suited for any scenario that requires confirming **all items** in an array meet a common requirement.
