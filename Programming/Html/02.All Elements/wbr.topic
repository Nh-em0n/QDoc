[üîó mdn-doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/wbr)

The `<wbr>` (Word Break Opportunity) tag in HTML is a **useful inline element** that provides the browser with a **hint about where it can safely break a long word** or URL when wrapping text. This helps improve the readability and layout of content, especially on narrow screens or responsive designs.

---

### Purpose of `<wbr>`

The `<wbr>` tag tells the browser:
**‚ÄúIf you need to break the line, you may break it here.‚Äù**

It does **not** create a visible effect until the word needs to wrap. It‚Äôs purely a *logical suggestion* for line-breaking.

---

### Syntax

```html
<wbr>
```

* It is an **empty tag**‚Äîit has no closing tag.
* It is placed **within long words or strings** where breaking is acceptable.

---

### Example

```html
<p>Visit our site at: www.example<wbr>.com</p>
```

If the screen is too narrow to display the full URL, the browser can break it like:

```
www.example
.com
```

Instead of forcing horizontal scrolling or shrinking the text.



### Practise

Try to break the ==red colored== word

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long URLs                | `https://www.verylong<wbr>url.com`                                |

| Prevent layout breaking  | In mobile/responsive views, especially in `<p>`, `<span>`, `` |

### Things to Remember

* `<wbr>` does **not** insert a space or hyphen.
* It only gives the browser **permission** to break the word at that point **if needed**.
* It has **no visual effect** unless the line actually wraps.

### Conclusion
