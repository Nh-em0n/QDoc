After 5 years I found a simple solution to share my mobile file with my PC.
It does not require any Wi-Fi connection, cable, or external software.

As mobile and pc is connected with same network internet data pack will not reduce.

### Connect within 10 Seconds

At first turn on mobile hotspot and connect you pc with this network.Then flow these steps :

1. Download [FE File Explorer](https://www.gooog.com)

2. Install it

3. Open it

4. Click on **`FTP Server`**

6. Open Windows **File Explorer** â†’ go to the **address bar** and paste like this:

   ```bash
   ftp://IP:Port
   ```

   Example (for me the FTP URL is):

   ```bash
   ftp://10.133.126.166:2121
   ```
