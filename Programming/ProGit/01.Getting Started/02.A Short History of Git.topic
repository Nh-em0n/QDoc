As with many great innovations, **Git** was born from a mix of **creative destruction** and **fiery controversy**.

### Early Linux Development (1991–2002)

The **Linux kernel**, a large and complex open-source project, initially relied on **patches** and **archived files** passed around between developers to manage changes. This process worked but was cumbersome and inefficient as the project grew.

### The BitKeeper Era (2002–2005)

In 2002, the Linux community adopted a **proprietary Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** called **BitKeeper**. This tool was a significant improvement in workflow and collaboration for the kernel's development.

However, in 2005, the relationship between the Linux community and the company behind BitKeeper deteriorated. The company revoked the tool's free-of-charge status, leaving the Linux community without a version control system that met their needs.

### The Birth of Git (2005)

This conflict led **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux) and the Linux development community to build their own tool. Drawing on lessons learned from BitKeeper, they established a set of goals for their new system:

* **Speed**
* **Simple design**
* **Strong support for non-linear development** (e.g., thousands of parallel branches)
* **Fully distributed**
* **Efficient handling of large projects** (both in terms of performance and data size)

### Git's Evolution

Since its creation in 2005, **Git** has matured into a powerful and widely-used version control system. It retains the qualities it was originally designed for:

* **Blazing-fast operations**
* **Efficiency at scale**
* **Robust branching and merging system** to support non-linear workflows

Git is now the **de facto standard** for version control in both open-source and enterprise software development.
