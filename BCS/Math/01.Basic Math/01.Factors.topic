#### 1. **Dividend**

The number **being divided**.
Example: In `20 ÷ 4`, the number **20** is the dividend.

#### 2. **Divisor**

The number you **divide by**.
Example: In `20 ÷ 4`, the number **4** is the divisor.

#### 3. **Quotient**

The **result** or answer of the division (without remainder).
Example: In `20 ÷ 4 = 5`, the number **5** is the quotient.

#### 4. **Remainder**

The **amount left over** if the division does not result in a whole number.
Example: `22 ÷ 4 = 5 remainder 2`
Here:

* Dividend = 22
* Divisor = 4
* Quotient = 5
* Remainder = 2

Note : Dividend = ( Divisor  x Quotient ) + Remainder {.note}

22 = ( 4 x 5 ) + 2

#### 5. **Divisible**

A number is **divisible** by another if it divides **exactly** (with zero remainder).
Example:

* **20 is divisible by 4** (because remainder is 0).
* **22 is not divisible by 4** (remainder is 2).

---

### Example Breakdown

Let’s take:
**27 ÷ 6**

* **Dividend** = 27
* **Divisor** = 6
* **Quotient** = 4
* **Remainder** = 3
  (because `6 × 4 = 24` and `27 - 24 = 3`)

A **factor** of a number is a whole number that divides the given number **exactly**, leaving **no remainder**. 

**In simple terms, if `a × b = c`**, 
- then both `a` and `b` are factors of `c`.
- both `c / a`  or  `c / b` is a whole number without remainder


#### Example:

* 6 is a factor of 18, because `6 × 3 = 18`.
* 2 is a factor of 10, because `2 × 5 = 10`.

---

### Why is 4 a factor of 24?{.text-center .text-light}

Because **24 ÷ 4 = 6** with **no remainder**.

* That means 4 divides 24 **exactly**.
* Also, `4 × 6 = 24`, which proves 4 is a factor.

---

### Why is 5 not a factor of 24?{.text-center .text-light}

Because **24 ÷ 5 = 4.8** which is **not a whole number**.


</md></sn><sn><md>### Properties of Factors{.text-end .fg-teal}

1. **Every number has at least two factors:**
   `1` and the number itself.
   Example: Factors of 7 are `1` and `7`.

2. **Factors are always less than or equal to the number.**
   A factor of 12 can be 1, 2, 3… but not 13 or more.

3. **Factors come in pairs:**
   If `a × b = n`, then both `a` and `b` are factors of `n`.
   Example:
   For 12:

   * `1 × 12`
   * `2 × 6`
   * `3 × 4`
     So, factors are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Types of Factors{.text-end .fg-o}


#### 1. **Proper Factors**

All factors of a number except the number itself.
Example: Proper factors of 10 are `1, 2, 5`.

#### 2. **Prime Factors**

Factors that are **prime numbers**.
Example: Prime factors of 18 are `2 and 3` (because `18 = 2 × 3 × 3`).

#### 3. **Common Factors**

Factors that are **shared** by two or more numbers.
Example:

* Factors of 12 = `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`
* Factors of 18 = `1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18`
* **Common factors** = `1, 2, 3, 6`
</md></sn><sn><md>### How to Find Factors{.text-end .fg-green}

- **Step 1:** Start dividing the number by `1` and go up to the number itself.
- **Step 2:** If the division gives no remainder, the divisor is a factor.

#### Factors of 16

* 16 ÷ 1 = 16 ✔
* 16 ÷ 2 = 8 ✔
* 16 ÷ 3 = 5.33 ✖
* 16 ÷ 4 = 4 ✔
* 16 ÷ 8 = 2 ✔
* 16 ÷ 16 = 1 ✔

**Factors(16)**: `1, 2, 4, 8, 16`
</md></sn><sn><md>### Convenient Way{.text-end .fg-o3}

This method is convenient because it reduces the number of factors to calculate up to 24


##### FactorsOf(24)


| Multiplier | Co-factor | Status       |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1          | 24        | ✅ True       |
| 2          | 12        | ✅ True       |
| 3          | 8         | ✅ True       |
| 4          | 6         | ✅ True (End Point) |
| 5          | 4         | ❌ Not True   |

After ==end Point== we have to go up.
