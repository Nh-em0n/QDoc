<sn><md>## Concept{.fg-red .text-center}

If you follow this note,then you already familiar with verb ==five form==,where both `v1` and `v5` used in present form.

Now when to use `v1` and `v5` actually depend on ==Person== is Singular or Plural. 

| Singular Noun | Pluarl Noun |
|----------|----------|
| Chair    | Chair`s`    |
| Mango    | Mango`es`    |


| Pluarl Verb ( **v1** ) | Singular Verb( **v5** ) |
|----------|----------|
| Eat    | `Eats`    |
| Walk    | `Walks`    |

Now
* Singular Verb `v5` for Singular Noun
  * `He` ==eats== mango.
* Pluaral Verb `v1` for Plural Noun
  * `They` ==eat== mango.

</md></sn><sn><md>## I `Exception` {.text-center}

Though `I` is a singluar noun so It should take singular verb but `I` has some exception

* I `eats` mango. ( ‚ùå )
* I `eat` mango. (‚úîÔ∏è) 


| Only take singluar verb | Else take all plural verb |
|----------|----------|
| am,was    | do,have,write,eat    |
