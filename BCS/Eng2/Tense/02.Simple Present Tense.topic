<sn><md>## Concept{.fg-red .text-center}

If you follow this note,then you already familiar with verb ==five form==,where both `v1` and `v5` used in present form.

Now when to use `v1` and `v5` actually depend on ==Person== is Singular or Plural. 

| Singular Noun | Pluarl Noun |
|----------|----------|
| Chair    | Chair`s`    |
| Mango    | Mango`es`    |


| Pluarl Verb ( **v1** ) | Singular Verb( **v5** ) |
|----------|----------|
| Eat    | `Eats`    |
| Walk    | `Walks`    |

Now
* Singular Verb `v5` for Singular Noun
  * `He` ==eats== mango.
* Pluaral Verb `v1` for Plural Noun
  * `They` ==eat== mango.

</md></sn><sn><md>## I `Exception` {.text-center}

Though `I` is a singluar noun so It should take singular verb but `I` has some exception

* I `eats` mango. ( ‚ùå )
* I `eat` mango. (‚úîÔ∏è) 


| Only take singluar verb | Else take all plural verb |
|----------|----------|
| am,was    | do,have,write,eat    |
</md></sn><sn><md>## U1 : Habitual , Repeated Action {.fg-red .text-end}

* My mother ==goes== to temple everyday.
* I ==get== up early in the morning.
* My father ==works== late at night.

### Time expressions of Habitual actions

| every + time | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| every day    | seldom,never,often,usually    |
| every night    | Occasionally,frequently,usually,generally    |
| every morning,evening   | Once/Twice a week     |
| every week,month,year    | hardly,rearely,scarcel,    |
|  daily  | *Always    |


#### She is hardly talking to me.{.text-center}

* The given sentence is in present continuos tense
* Okay,but the word `hardly` represent that the action is `habitual`,the it must be in present simple form
* The structure of present simple form is ==sub+ v1/v5 + obj== ,as `she` is singular so verb will be in `singular v5` form
* Ans . **Sub + v5 + obj**
* Ans . She hardly ==talks== to me

#### She is seldom coming late.{.text-center}
* The given sentence is in present continuos tense
* Okay,but the word `seldom` represent that the action is `habitual`,the it must be in present simple form
* The structure of present simple form is ==sub+ v1/v5 + obj== ,since `she` is singular so verb will be in `singular v5` form
* Ans . **Sub + v5 + obj**
* Ans . She seldom ==comes== late

#### During holidays we are often working in my uncle school{.text-center}
* The given sentence is in present continuos tense
* Okay,but the word `often` represent that the action is `habitual`,the it must be in present simple form

</md></sn><sn><md>## Always{.fg-red .text-center}

Though always seems a habitual word but it has an `exception`.

| Habit | Irritation |
|----------|----------|
| Present Simple    | Present Continuous    |
| sub + v1 / v5 + obj    | sub + am / is / are + v-ing + obj   |
| She `always` ==speaks== the truth    | She is `always` ==complaing== about her husband   |


#### He is always talking about his work whenever they meet. {.text-center}
* The sentence is in present continuous,but it contains the always it should be in present simple tense
* But if always is used for irritation then it will be in present coninuous form which it is already in
* So the sentence is ==Correct==

#### He is always going for a walk after dinner. 
* The sentence is in present continuous,but it contains the always it should be in present simple tense
* As `always` do not feel like irriation so i am 100% sure it will be in present simple form
* Ans : He is always ==goes== for a walk after dinner(error).
* Ans : He always ==goes== for a walk after dinner(solved).


</md></sn><sn><md>## Universal Truth{.fg-red .text-center}

* The earth ==moves== round the sun.
* The sun ==rises== in the west.
* Plants ==give== us oxygen.

#### The people in ancient time belived that the sun moves round the Earth.{.text-center}

* The sentence has two clause ==The people in ancient time belived that== and ==the sun moves round the Earth==.
* The first clause contain `in + tiems` so it will be in past simple which it is 
* But the second caluse ==the sun moves round the earth== ,the second caluse is not `univeral truth` ,so it will inhert the tense from the fast caluse
* a universal fact must be valid till present
* Ans. the sun `moved` round the Earth.

#### The scientist belived that the gravitional force pulls down everything.{.text-center}

* This sentence has also 2 cluase,where the first clause is ==The scientist belived== which is correct past,and 
* The second clause ==gravitional force pulls down everyhing.== ,is in present simple form and as it is `universal truth` so second caluse is also corrent
* Ans : Already Correct
</md></sn><sn><md>## Expressing Future with Present Tense{.fg-red .text-center}

---

Simple Present Tense has no `hv` is its affirmative structure.We use `do/does` as a `hv` in its negative and interrogative form.Where `do` is for plural noun and `does` is for singular noun.

::: .bar
#### üìùNote{.fg-blue}
* ==Do/Does/Did== is only used as `hv` for negative and interrogative form, ==not for simpler form==
* The main verb in negative and interrogative is always `v1`,as ==hv represent the Person==
