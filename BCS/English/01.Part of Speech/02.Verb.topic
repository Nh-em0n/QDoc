A sentence can be formed without a helping verb, but it cannot be formed without a main verb.

#### **What is a Helping Verb?**
A helping verb is an additional verb placed before the main verb to provide extra information, such as:
- **Tense** (When the action occurs)
- **Forming negative and interrogative sentences**

#### **Examples**
- **I *am* **going** to London.**
  - In this example, *am* is the helping verb, and **going** is the main verb.
  
- **They *have* **gone** to London.**
  - Here, *have* is the helping verb, and **gone** is the main verb.

**Note**: A **helping verb** becomes the **main verb** if it is the only verb in the sentence, as a sentence cannot be formed without a main verb.
- **I **have** four sons.**
- **She **was** a singer.**

In these examples, **have** and **was** are the main verbs in their respective sentences.

#### **Helping Verb as the Main Verb**
Consider the example:
- **I am a teacher.**
  - In this sentence, *am* is the only verb, so it functions as the main verb. The tense here is present simple, as *am* is in the *V1* form.

#### **Evaluating Verb Type, Form, and Sentence Tense**

- **He **is** a good man.**
  - Here, **is** is the main verb since there is no other verb. **Is** is in the *V5* (s/es) form, so the sentence is in the present simple tense.

- **He *is* **learning** English.**
  - In this sentence, there are two verbs: *is* (helping verb) and **learning** (main verb).
  - *Is* is in the *V5* form, and **learning** is in the *V4* form. Thus, the sentence is in the present continuous tense.</md></sn><sn><md>##  **Finite vs Non-Finite Verbs**
