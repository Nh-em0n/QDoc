## Transitive Verb

Mainverb is devided into two categories

| Transitive | Intransitive |
|----------|----------|
| Always take an object | doesnt take any object |



### Obeject Recap

+++

An object is either a **noun** or a **pronoun**.

#### **Types of Objects**
- **Verb Object** (noun/pronoun immediately after the verb)
- **Preposition Object** (noun/pronoun immediately after the preposition)

Objects are always associated with either verbs or prepositions.

#### **Preposition Object**
A preposition object occurs when a **preposition** is followed by a noun or pronoun.  
- **Preposition <space> Object = Preposition Object**

Thus, any noun or pronoun that directly follows a preposition is the preposition's object.

#### **Verb Object**
A verb object occurs when a **verb** is directly linked to a noun or pronoun without any intervening preposition.  
- **Verb + What/Whom = Verb Object**
- `verb + article/adjective + noun/pronoun` = verb object
- `verb` + preposition + `noun/pronoun` = preposition object
- `verb` + no noun/preposition = not an object (an object must be noun/pronoun)

ðŸ‘‰ Important points:
- If a noun/pronoun follows the verb (ignoring articles or adjectives) and no preposition is present, that noun/pronoun is the **verb object**.
- If a preposition comes immediately after the verb, the object belongs to the **preposition**, not the verb.
- To confirm, question the main verb by inserting **what** or **whom** immediately after the verb, ignoring all other words.

##### **Example**
- **The supporter ran away from the meeting.**
  - Wrong way: "The supporter ran away from what?"
  - Correct way: "The supporter ran what?"

Since **ran** is not directly linked to a noun/pronoun without a preposition, there is **no verb object** here.

#### **Note**
- An object must be a **noun** or **pronoun**, never an adjective, adverb, preposition, or article.
- An object is **one word** (e.g., *man*, *woman*, *he*), not a phrase (e.g., *a blind man*, *pink car*).</space>

+++

&gt; **Summary :** verb -&gt; noun/pronoun = verb has object = transitive verb
&gt; ** verb -&gt; prepositino -&gt; noun/pronoun = preposition object so verb has not any object = intransitive verb

- **He** is a pronoun.
- **Kicked** is the verb in the *V2* form.
- **The ball** is the object, which is a noun. Since **ball** comes immediately after the verb **kicked** without any intervening preposition, **ball** is the object of the verb **kicked**.

ðŸ‘‰ To confirm, we question the verb by **what** or **whom**:
- He kicked **what**? (Answer: The ball)
- He kicked **whom**? (Answer: The ball)

Thus, **the ball**:
- Is a **noun** (based on part of speech)
- Functions as an **object**
- Serves as the **verb object** for the verb **kicked**.</md></sn><sn><md>#### **Example Analysis**
