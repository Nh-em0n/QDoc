<sn><md>### **Object**

An object is either a **noun** or a **pronoun**.

#### **Types of Objects**
- **Verb Object** (noun/pronoun immediately after the verb)
- **Preposition Object** (noun/pronoun immediately after the preposition)

Objects are always associated with either verbs or prepositions.

#### **Preposition Object**
A preposition object occurs when a **preposition** is followed by a noun or pronoun.  
- **Preposition &lt;space&gt; Object = Preposition Object**

Thus, any noun or pronoun that directly follows a preposition is the preposition's object.

#### **Verb Object**
A verb object occurs when a **verb** is directly linked to a noun or pronoun without any intervening preposition.  
- **Verb + What/Whom = Verb Object**
- `verb + article/adjective + noun/pronoun` = verb object
- `verb` + preposition + `noun/pronoun` = preposition object
- `verb` + no noun/preposition = not an object (an object must be noun/pronoun)

ðŸ‘‰ Important points:
- If a noun/pronoun follows the verb (ignoring articles or adjectives) and no preposition is present, that noun/pronoun is the **verb object**.
- If a preposition comes immediately after the verb, the object belongs to the **preposition**, not the verb.
- To confirm, question the main verb by inserting **what** or **whom** immediately after the verb, ignoring all other words.

##### **Example**
- **The supporter ran away from the meeting.**
  - Wrong way: "The supporter ran away from what?"
  - Correct way: "The supporter ran what?"

Since **ran** is not directly linked to a noun/pronoun without a preposition, there is **no verb object** here.

#### **Note**
- An object must be a **noun** or **pronoun**, never an adjective, adverb, preposition, or article.
- An object is **one word** (e.g., *man*, *woman*, *he*), not a phrase (e.g., *a blind man*, *pink car*).&lt;/space&gt;</md></sn><config style="display:none"><tags>#11.object</tags><thumbnail></thumbnail><heading></heading><udate>Sat Jul 19 2025 08:16:16 GMT+0600 (Bangladesh Standard Time)</udate><id>article-IvLM5pXnij</id><duration></duration></config><sn><md>#### **Example: He kicked the ball.**

- **He** is a pronoun.
- **Kicked** is the verb in the *V2* form.
- **The ball** is the object, which is a noun. Since **ball** comes immediately after the verb **kicked** without any intervening preposition, **ball** is the object of the verb **kicked**.

ðŸ‘‰ To confirm, we question the verb by **what** or **whom**:
- He kicked **what**? (Answer: The ball)
- He kicked **whom**? (Answer: The ball)

Thus, **the ball**:
- Is a **noun** (based on part of speech)
- Functions as an **object**
- Serves as the **verb object** for the verb **kicked**.</md></sn><sn><md>#### **Example Analysis**

---

##### **The baby was crying**
- **Baby** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.
- **Was** is the helping verb; **crying** is the main verb.
- No noun or pronoun follows the verb, so there is **no object** for the verb **crying**.

---

##### **She came on time**
- **She** is a pronoun.
- **Came** is the main verb in *V2* form.
- **On** is a preposition.
- **Time** is a noun acting as an object.
  - Since **time** follows the preposition **on**, it is the **object of the preposition on**.

---

##### **I am going to London**
- **I** is a pronoun.
- **Am** is the helping verb; **going** is the main verb in *V4* (-ing) form.
- **To** is a preposition.
- **London** is a noun following the preposition **to**, making it the **object of the preposition to**.

##### **Rahul speaks loudly**
- **Rahul** is a noun.
- **Speaks** is the main verb in *V5* (-s/es) form.
- **Loudly** is an adverb.
  - Since adverbs are neither nouns nor pronouns, **loudly** is **not an object**.

---

##### **I saw a sick man** (ðŸ‘‰ Important)
- **I** is a pronoun functioning as the subject.
- **Saw** is the main verb in *V2* form.
- **A sick man**:
  - **Man** is the noun, preceded by the adjective **sick** and the article **a**.
  - Despite the article and adjective, **man** is directly linked to the verb **saw**, making it the **object of the verb saw**.

ðŸ‘‰ Further clarification:
- I saw **what**? (Answer: Man)
- I saw **whom**? (Answer: Man)

Thus, **man** is the **verb object**.

##### **The supporters ran away from the meeting**
- **Supporters** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**, acting as the subject.
- **Ran** is the main verb in *V2* form.
- **From** is a preposition.
- **Meeting** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.
  - Since **meeting** follows the preposition **from**, it is the **object of the preposition from**.
  - **Meeting** is **not** the object of the verb **ran**.

- **Prices** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.
- **Car** is a noun following the preposition **of**.
- **Have** is a helping verb; **fallen** is the main verb in *V3* form.
- **Sharply** is an adverb modifying the verb **fallen**.

#### **She killed him**
- `She` is  pronoun
- `killed` is the main verb in v2 form
